	<h4>Open House Sessions</h4>
	<br>
	<p>
Open House are free interactive sessions conducted weekly after board examinations of Grade 12 until the start of the DWIT Aptitude Tests. Prospective students can join the session to learn about different aspects of DWIT, as well as to get their queries related to admissions and life at DWIT answered. These informative sessions also inform the participants about studying Computer Science and its scope.
<br>
<br>
Attending DWIT Open House does not compel a student to apply at DWIT. In fact, the students are highly encouraged to attend this session, and get a glimpse of studying Computer Science before deciding on their career paths.</p>
