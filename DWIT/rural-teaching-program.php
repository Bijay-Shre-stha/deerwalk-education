    <p class="lead page-desc-text">The cornerstone of Deerwalk’s teaching methodology rests on the
        foundations of Extensive Theoretical Exposure, Thorough Practical Excellence and All-Round
        Personality. The teaching fellowship program is designed to help develop student’s all-around
        personality. <br><br>

        The students who have successfully undergone four years of B.Sc.CSIT course in DWIT is eligible
        to become a part of this program. The primary aim of the program is to help students that have
        limited access to good teachers and other teaching facilities in the core subject of computing.
        The fellow is expected to find the gaps that exist there and help fulfill them. It could be by
        helping the school design its website or provide tutoring on any subjects.<br><br>

        The program will run for minimum eight weeks with accommodation and food provided by the school
        free of cost and a stipend of Rs. Five Thousand per month by DWIT.</p>
