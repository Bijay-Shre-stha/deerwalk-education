<!--Clubs Description-->

<div class="container-fluid page-desc">
    <p class="lead page-desc-text">Our students come from different cities and towns of Nepal.
        Today, we have a vibrant student community representing Far East to the far west of the country
        with diverse economic, social and cultural backgrounds. We aspire to give our students more than
        just a degree with competence in core subjects. We want our students to learn to become better
        people who can contribute substantially to their community. We hope to instill skills and
        qualities in our students that help them to attain overall success in their careers and other
        endeavors by learning to be respectful of others and working collaboratively as part of a team.
        A detailed profile of each of the students can be read in the official blog site of the college
        doko.dwit.edu.np.</p>

                            DeerCoders and conducted Deerthon 2014 successfully. Our vision is to
                            organize a healthy Inter and Intra College Hackathon and other coding
                            competitions that will provide students a competitive environment to
                            build up a minimum viable product using their technical and non-technical
                            skills.</p>

                            engaged in conducting light-hearted programmes such as talk shows, podcasts
                            and debates. It was started with the intention of getting to know the people
                            we are surrounded by within the Deerwalk premises, but has expanded to guests
                            outside Deerwalk too in about one year of its formation.
