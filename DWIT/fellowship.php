        The fellowship will entail instructing a diverse student body of Nepalese college students in
        oral and written English comprehension, focusing on improving international proficiency
        throughout their tenure at DWIT. The fellow will be expected to quickly assess the language
        proficiency of all students and then develop a diverse curriculum to address the different
        levels of proficiency. The fellow will be responsible for teaching one class to each of the
        four grade levels. Class size is a maximum of 24 students, with a total of 48 students per grade
        level. Students have learned best when professors use blended learning techniques including pop
        culture, current events, social media and experiential learning. Such practices better equip IT
        students to perform in international jobs where they interact with English speakers from multiple
        backgrounds. Every class needs a minimum of a lesson plan, midterm exam and final exam. However,
        continuous feedback through written exercise, oral recording and group skill building has proven
        successful. Each student arrives at DWIT with a diverse set of skills and talents. A successful
        teacher is able to harness student creativity, talents and non-technical interests to engage the
        class. Length of fellowship: 5-10 months (option to stay for a half or full school year).
